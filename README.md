# Installation
---

If you would like to download the repo and check out the code, open up your terminal and paste in the following:

```

```


If you were able to clone it successfully, you should see the following in your project's root directory:

( You won't see the node_modules folder and that's okay. )


If you just want to browse the code, you will see the compiled SCSS as CSS in `frontend/dist/styles` as well as the javascript inside `frontend/dist/scripts`. The HTML file is located in the root directory.



# Updating code
---



If you want to update and play around with the code, make sure you have node and npm installed. This project uses a gulpfile to track changes in files and output them into the dist folder.


run `npm start` in the root directory of the project and npm will install all the project's dependencies and then spin up a local server. You should then see the calculator int he browser. To make changes to the code, you'll need to work in the `src` directory. `frontend/src/styles` and `frontend/src/scripts`
